  <h1>Snake Game</h1>
  <p>
    This repository contains an implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. Control a snake, navigate it to eat food, and watch it grow while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Run the Game:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/Rehab-Adel/snake-game.git</code></li>
    <li>Open the project in your preferred Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm).</li>
    <li>Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed: Turtle, Time, and Random.</li>
    <li>Run the <code>Snake-Game.py</code> file.</li>
    <li>Enjoy playing the Snake Game!</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Python Libraries Used:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html" target="_blank">Turtle</a> - A graphics library for Python that provides a simple and intuitive way to create graphics and animations.</li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" target="_blank">Time</a> - A Python module that provides various time-related functions, including time delay in the game loop.</li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_blank">Random</a> - A Python module that offers functions for generating pseudo-random numbers, used for generating food positions in the game.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Game Controls:</h2>
  <p>
    Use the W, S, A, and D keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right). The game will end if the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
